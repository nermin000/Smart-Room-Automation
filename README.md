Smart Room Automation System using ESP32 and Blynk IoT
======================================================

Overview
--------

This project demonstrates a sophisticated **Smart Room Automation System** leveraging the ESP32 microcontroller, Blynk IoT platform, and a suite of environmental sensors. It integrates real-time environmental monitoring and intelligent control logic to enhance comfort, energy efficiency, and remote management in residential or office spaces.

Key Features
------------

*   **Motion-Activated Lighting:** Utilizes a PIR sensor to detect presence and automatically control room lighting, enhancing convenience and power savings.
    
*   **Ambient Brightness Sensing:** Employs an LDR sensor to evaluate natural light levels, avoiding unnecessary artificial lighting. LDR threshold is stored in EEPROM for persistence.
    
*   **Temperature-Based AC Control:** Integrates DHT22 sensor readings to manage air conditioning via relay, with configurable hysteresis for smooth operation.
    
*   **Real-Time Clock Scheduling:** Uses DS3231 RTC to implement sleep modes during designated off-hours, optimizing power consumption.
    
*   **EEPROM-Based Configuration:** Stores user-defined parameters like LDR threshold and sleep schedule, preserving settings across reboots.
    
*   **Dual Control Interface:** Supports manual override via physical switch and remote control through the Blynk mobile app, allowing flexible user interaction.
    
*   **Status Display:** Provides real-time feedback on system states and current time on an I2C LCD display.
    
*   **Power-Efficient Operation:** Implements ESP32 light sleep during off-hours to reduce energy usage without sacrificing responsiveness.
    
*   **Task-Based Architecture:** Utilizes TaskScheduler for concurrent, non-blocking task management.
