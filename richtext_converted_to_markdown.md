\# 🧠 Algorithm: Smart Lighting & AC Control System## ✅ Step 1: System Startup (Initialization)1. Start the system.2. Load saved settings from EEPROM.3. If settings are missing or incorrect: - Load default settings. - Save the defaults back to memory.4. Connect to Wi-Fi using saved credentials.5. Connect to Blynk using the provided authentication token.6. Set up all hardware: - Sensors (PIR, LDR, DHT22) - LCD display - Real-Time Clock (RTC)7. If the RTC lost power: - Reset it to a default time.8. Apply saved settings: - Control the LED and AC according to saved override states.---## 🔁 Step 2: Main Loop- Keep running scheduled tasks repeatedly: - Handle Blynk app events. - Read sensor values. - Update LED, AC, and LCD. - Check if the system should enter sleep mode.---## 📡 Step 3: Read Sensors- Check motion sensor (PIR).- Measure brightness using LDR.- Read temperature from DHT22.- Read the manual override switch.- Get the current time from the RTC.---## 💡 Step 4: Control the LED- Turn ON the LED if: - Blynk light override is ON \*\*OR\*\* - Manual switch is pressed \*\*OR\*\* - The room is dark \*\*AND\*\* motion is detected.- Otherwise, turn OFF the LED.---## ❄️ Step 5: Control the AC- If Blynk AC override is ON: - Keep the AC ON.- Otherwise: - Turn ON the AC if: - Motion is detected \*\*AND\*\* temperature > high limit. - Turn OFF the AC if: - Temperature < low limit \*\*OR\*\* no motion is detected.---## 📺 Step 6: Update the LCD Display- Line 1: Show the current time (\`HH:MM:SS\`)- Line 2: Show one of the following messages: - \`Manual Override\` - \`Blynk Control ON\` - \`Motion Detected\` - \`No Motion\` - \`Room is Bright\`- If AC is ON, prepend \`AC ON |\` to the message.---## 💾 Step 7: Save Changes from Blynk- If the user changes LED or AC from the app: - Update settings in memory. - Save them back to EEPROM with CRC for safety.---## 🌙 Step 8: Sleep Mode for Power Saving- If the time is \*\*before 6:00 AM or after 11:00 PM\*\*: - Go into light sleep for a few seconds. - Wake up automatically and resume normal operation.---## 📝 Notes- This algorithm controls hardware devices like a relay and an LED based on environmental inputs and app commands.- It uses task scheduling, EEPROM storage, and a real-time clock for reliable, low-power automation.
